# Word Counter

A simple command-line file editor built in Python. This tool allows you to read, write, and view basic information about text files! It includes features like word counting, timestamps, and easy line breaks. I  created this as a project for a CSP2 class at UCAS.

## Features
- **File Editing**: Add or remove content from text files without opening them in a full editor.
- **Word Counter**: Automatically counts words in your file.
- **Timestamps**: Tracks when changes are made.
- **New Lines**: Insert new lines by typing "***".
- **File Info**: View basic file details, including size and Path

## Requirements
- Python 3+.

## Installation
No installation needed! Simply clone or download the repository and run the script in your terminal or VS Code!

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `Main/` directory in your terminal.
2. Run the script: `python Main.py`
3. Enter the exact path to the text file you want to edit (e.g., `/path/to/your/file.txt`).
4. Choose an action:
   - **add**: you get to add something to your file!
   - **remove**: same as add, but you get to remove something from the file!
   - **view**: just shows you what is in the file
   - **info**: Show file details, including word count and also the path to your file
   - **quit**: quits the program!
5. Repeat as needed.

Example:
```
Enter the exact path to your file: example.txt
Do you want to add, remove, view, or view info about your file?
Enter your choice (add/remove/view/info/quit): add
Enter text:  Hello world! *** This is a new line.
```
